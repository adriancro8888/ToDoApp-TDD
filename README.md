# ToDoApp_TDD

This App created to get to know with Unit and UI Tests.

Applacation was creating by the TDD concentration and Uncle Bob's rules.

It's simple To Do List. <br />
I started with test, continued with main code, and then continied with test again.
All tests were passed.

Example of recording UI Test in demo.
